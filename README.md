Introduction to Node.js
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling the development of scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building high-performance applications.

What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. It enables clients to request only the data they need, allowing for more predictable and efficient data fetching. GraphQL empowers developers to define the structure of the data they require, making it easier to iterate on APIs and fetch data from multiple sources with a single request.
